            <h3>Monaco</h3>
                <p>
                    I would love to see the prince's palace.<br>
                    Visit the Oceanographic Museum is a temple to art and science.<br> Apart from its world-class aquariums, there's a touch pool, shark lagoon, turtle island, fish nursery and exhibition hall.<br>
                    Monaco is all about the ocean, and the best place to check it out is Larvotto Beach, perhaps the most glamorous waterfront in the world.<br> would also love  to see the casino de monte-carlo.<br>
                    I would love to enjoy the food  as well.
